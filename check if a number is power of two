# 💡 Concept: A number is a power of 2 if it has only ONE bit set in its binary form.
# For example:
# 1 -> 0001
# 2 -> 0010
# 4 -> 0100
# 8 -> 1000
# 16 -> 0001 0000
# All have only one ‘1’ bit set.

# 🔍 Trick:
# If a number n is a power of two, then n & (n-1) == 0.
# Because (n-1) flips all bits after the single 1 in n, removing that bit when ANDed.

# Example:
# n = 8 -> 1000
# n-1 = 7 -> 0111
# n & (n-1) = 0000 ✅ → power of 2

# n = 10 -> 1010
# n-1 = 9  -> 1001
# n & (n-1) = 1000 ❌ → not power of 2

# 🧠 Also check n > 0, since for n = 0 the condition is true but 0 isn’t a power of 2.

# ✅ C++ code:
bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    return (n > 0) && ((n & (n - 1)) == 0);
}
