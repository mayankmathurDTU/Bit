⚙️ Conceptual Explanation:
# When we subtract 1 from a number:
#   - All bits to the right of the rightmost 1 become 1.
#   - The rightmost 1 itself becomes 0.

# Example: n = 12 (1100)
# n - 1 = 11 (1011)
#
# 1100
# & 1011
# -------
# 1000   ← rightmost set bit removed!

# Example 4 (bigger):
# n = 156 -> 1001 1100
# n-1 = 155 -> 1001 1011
# n & (n-1) = 1001 1000 -> 152 ✅ last set bit removed

# Example 5 (bigger):
# n = 1024 -> 0100 0000 0000
# n-1 = 1023 -> 0011 1111 1111
# n & (n-1) = 0000 0000 0000 -> 0 ✅ all bits cleared (since n had only one set bit)

# Example 6:
# n = 999 -> 1111 1001 11
# n-1 = 998 -> 1111 1001 10
# n & (n-1) = 1111 1001 10 -> 998 ✅ removes the lowest set bit

# Hence formula:
# ✅ n & (n - 1) removes the last set bit

# -------------------------------------
# 🧠 Why it works:
# Subtracting 1 flips all bits after the rightmost 1 (including that 1),
# and ANDing it removes that 1, keeping higher bits unchanged.

# C++ code:
int removeLastSetBit(int n) {
    return n & (n - 1);
}
